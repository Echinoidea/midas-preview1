The duplicate lookups have been fixed.

* Okay, uploading is fixed, now optimizing for speed.
** Indexing RiskLookup table: Time taken for uploading 500 rows CSV:
*** Before: 500 rows takes 52 seconds.
*** After: 500 rows takes 47 seconds. Insignifcant
** Speed optimization went poorly. Don't worry about it right now. At least there aren't huge joins everywhere.

* Setting up file uploading
<2025-02-23 Sun>
** Front-end
*** Consistent font
*** Use NextUI
*** Use same colors
** Back-end
*** Get rid of convoluted parsing. Just give the api the whole file.
